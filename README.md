This is a Markdown previewer I made using React.
In this project there is a text editor provided to you which converts plain text into HTML markup just by using some simple syntax.
For example, if you want a header of size h1 use a # followed by white space and then type the header in the text editor. 
It will converted into a header of size h1. 
If you want header of h2 size, then use 2 #s instead of 1 and much more.
